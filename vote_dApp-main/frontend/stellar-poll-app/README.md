## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) Chrome extension
- Freighter set to **Testnet** network

### Install & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stellar-poll-app.git
cd stellar-poll-app

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm start
```

App opens at `http://localhost:3000`

### Connect Your Wallet

1. Install [Freighter](https://freighter.app) Chrome extension
2. Open Freighter → click the network name → switch to **Testnet**
3. Get free testnet XLM from [Stellar Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_ADDRESS)
4. Click the **Freighter** card in the sidebar → click **Approve** in the popup
5. Your balance and address will appear in the sidebar

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (Live Demo)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repo at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) for auto-deploy on every push.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.js          # Main UI — wallet panel, poll card, activity feed
├── wallet.js       # useWallet hook — Freighter connection, balance, send XLM
├── contract.js     # Soroban contract calls — castVote, getResults
└── index.js        # React entry point
```

---

## 🔑 How It Works

### Wallet Connection (`wallet.js`)
Uses `@stellar/freighter-api` directly:
```js
await api.requestAccess();      // Opens Freighter popup → user approves
const key = await api.getPublicKey();  // Returns Stellar address
```

### Contract Calls (`contract.js`)
Calls the deployed Soroban smart contract on testnet:
```js
// Vote
contract.call("vote_yes", Address.fromString(wallet).toScVal())

// Read results
contract.call("get_results")
```

### 3 Error Types Handled
```
⛔ Rejected     — User dismissed the Freighter approval popup
🌐 Wrong network — Wallet is on Mainnet, not Testnet  
❌ Not found    — Freighter extension is not installed
```

### Real-time Sync
- Poll results auto-refresh every **5 seconds**
- Activity feed shows every vote with address, timestamp, and TX hash
- Your vote appears at the top of the feed instantly after confirmation

---

## 🔍 Transaction Verification

After casting a vote, the transaction hash is shown in the status bar.  
Verify it on Stellar Expert:

```
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/YOUR_TX_HASH
```

**Example transaction hash from a contract call:**  
`4cf1d790d2...` *(copy full hash from the app after voting)*

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `stellar-sdk` | 12.3.0 | Stellar transactions + Horizon API |
| `@stellar/freighter-api` | 2.1.0 | Freighter wallet connection |
| `react` | 19.x | UI framework |

## 🏗️ Smart Contract

The poll contract is written in Rust using the Soroban SDK and deployed to Stellar testnet.

**Contract functions:**
- `vote_yes(voter: Address)` — records a YES vote
- `vote_no(voter: Address)` — records a NO vote  
- `get_results()` — returns `(yes_count, no_count)`

**Deploy your own:**
```bash
# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install stellar-cli

# Build contract
cd contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Deploy to testnet
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/poll.wasm \
  --source YOUR_ACCOUNT \
  --network testnet
```
